### Gossip Glomers

These are my solutions for [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/).

All the tooling necessary to compile and run is managed with [Nix](https://nix.dev/) and [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/).

Each directory starting with a number is a solution to a given challenge and contains a `test.sh` script to run the test against Maelstrom and a `README.md` to describe the approach and the trade-offs.
